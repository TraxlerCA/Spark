Here is the updated README that reflects the generalization from Gemma to any LLM using Ollama, along with clearer steps and updated script naming:

---

# Ollama Python LLM Demo

This project shows how to interact with any locally hosted large language model (LLM) using Python and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

## Setup

1. Install Python (3.8+), pip, Git, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Download a model of your choice (e.g. Gemma 3.4b):

```bash
ollama pull gemma:3.4b
```

6. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## What you’ll learn

* How to set up a Python project with a virtual environment
* How to interact with LLMs hosted locally via Ollama's REST API
* How to structure code with functions, error handling, and comments for readability

## Notes

* The script is designed to be beginner-friendly and includes detailed comments.
* You can easily switch models by changing the `model` argument in the `ask_llm` function.

Let me know if you’d like me to update the actual file or generate a `requirements.txt` too.
